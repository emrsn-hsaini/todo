1. Based on the technologies suggested in #file:Technology.md I want to implement this application now. What are the next execution steps I should follow for creating this application in the workshop. Create a new file ExecutionPlan.md and detail out an implementation plan for next steps. Provide all the details adding substeps for guiding step by step on what and how to do. For any step which involves running a command, please consider powershell. Make sure the steps you give for initializing frontend and backend ensure that frontend and backend directories are parallel to each other.
