### Execution Plan for To-Do Application

This execution plan outlines the steps to create a To-Do application using the recommended technology stack.

---

#### Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Node.js and npm**
    - Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    - Verify the installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in the terminal.

2. **Set Up a New React Project**
    - Create a new React project using Create React App:
      ```powershell
      npx create-react-app todo-app
      cd todo-app
      ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**
    - Install Material-UI for UI components:
      ```powershell
      npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
      ```

4. **Set Up a Node.js and Express Backend**
    - Navigate to the root directory of your workspace:
      ```powershell
      cd ..
      ```
    - Create a new directory for the backend:
      ```powershell
      mkdir backend
      cd backend
      npm init -y
      npm install express mongoose dotenv jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
      ```

5. **Set Up MongoDB**
    - Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
    - Create a new database for the application.

---

#### Step 2: Develop the Frontend

1. **Create Basic UI Components**
    - Set up the basic structure of the application with components for the task list, task form, and user authentication.

2. **Implement User Registration and Login**
    - Create forms for user registration and login.
    - Use Material-UI components for styling.

3. **Develop Task Management Features**
    - Create components for adding new tasks and displaying the task list.
    - Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed.

4. **Make the UI Responsive**
    - Use CSS media queries to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes.

---

#### Step 3: Develop the Backend

1. **Set Up Express Server**
    - Create an Express server to handle API requests.
    - Set up routes for user registration, login, and task management.

2. **Implement User Authentication**
    - Use JWT for stateless authentication.
    - Implement middleware to protect routes.

3. **Set Up MongoDB Models**
    - Create Mongoose models for users and tasks.

4. **Develop API Endpoints**
    - Implement endpoints for user registration, login, adding tasks, and marking tasks as completed.

---

#### Step 4: Integrate Frontend and Backend

1. **Connect Frontend to Backend**
    - Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests from the React frontend to the Express backend.

2. **Handle Authentication**
    - Store JWT tokens in local storage or cookies.
    - Use tokens to authenticate API requests.

3. **Test the Application**
    - Test all features end-to-end to ensure they work as expected.

---

#### Step 5: Deployment

1. **Deploy Backend to Heroku**
    - Create a new Heroku app.
    - Deploy the Express backend to Heroku.

2. **Deploy Frontend to Heroku**
    - Build the React application for production.
    - Deploy the frontend to Heroku.

---

#### Step 6: Additional Tools

1. **Set Up Version Control with GitHub**
    - Initialize a Git repository and push the code to GitHub.
    - Use branches for feature development and pull requests for code reviews.

2. **Use Postman for API Testing**
    - Create Postman collections to test API endpoints.

3. **Write Unit Tests with Jest**
    - Write unit tests for both frontend and backend components.
