### Recommended Technology Stack for To-Do Application

To build a working application during the workshop that can be later enhanced to be production-ready, you should choose a technology stack that is both easy to set up and scalable. Here is a recommended stack:

---

#### Frontend

**1. React**
- **Description**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Reason**: React is widely used, has a large community, and is easy to learn for beginners. It also supports component-based architecture, which is great for building scalable applications.

**2. Material-UI**
- **Description**: A React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
- **Reason**: Provides pre-built components and a clean, modern design out of the box, which can save time on UI development.

---

#### Backend

**1. Node.js**
- **Description**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Reason**: Allows you to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, which can simplify development. It is also known for its performance and scalability.

**2. Express.js**
- **Description**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Reason**: Provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, and is easy to set up and use.

---

#### Database

**1. MongoDB**
- **Description**: A NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model.
- **Reason**: Flexible schema design, easy to scale, and integrates well with Node.js applications.

---

#### Authentication

**1. JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
- **Description**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- **Reason**: Simple to implement and widely used for stateless authentication.

---

#### Deployment

**1. Heroku**
- **Description**: A cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps.
- **Reason**: Easy to deploy applications, supports Node.js, and provides a free tier for initial development.

---

### Additional Tools

**1. GitHub**
- **Description**: A web-based platform used for version control.
- **Reason**: Essential for collaboration and version control, integrates well with GitHub Copilot.

**2. Postman**
- **Description**: A collaboration platform for API development.
- **Reason**: Useful for testing backend APIs.

**3. Jest**
- **Description**: A JavaScript testing framework.
- **Reason**: Easy to set up and use for writing unit tests for both frontend and backend.

---

### Summary

- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Deployment**: Heroku
- **Additional Tools**: GitHub, Postman, Jest

This stack is suitable for building a working application during the workshop and can be easily enhanced to be production-ready post-workshop.
